# Hangman
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

This project was developed in Python using the principles of object-oriented programming. There are three methods that make the game work:
<br>
<ol>
    <li>A method that starts the game and keeps track of the game's status until the user either runs out of lives or guesses the word.</li>
    <li>Two class methods:
    <ul><li>One to check the user's guess and update the game status accordingly.</li>
    <li>Another to ask for and check the user's input to ensure it is valid.</li></li></ul>
</ol>

To run this project, clone this repository and run the file in your terminal. A simple list of fruits has been provided, but you can add as many items as you want from different themes.
